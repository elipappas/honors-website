                    1 / Swift Learning Experience
                </h1>
                <p className="font-medium">
                    For this experience I spent time learning how to program in the language Swift. Swift is a programming language which was created by Apple 
                    and is used for programming all of their devices. My experience consisted of me reading through tutorials and watching videos which I collected 
                    and compiled into a swift file which has common applications of different ideas to help me if I ever forget the syntax of code or need to see how 
                    I would go about creating a new function in my code. This experience has been very impactful on me, I have applied this idea that I have done here
                    and used it for multiple other programming languages such as C++ which I already have experience in, but the cheat sheet like file has been extremely 
                    helpful, and more recently I have also learned Java for my upcoming co-op where that will be my primary language I am using. This experience has also 
                    allowed me to test the waters of self learning, especially in computer science. Up until now most of my programming experience had come from the classroom, 
                    but by participating in this self-designed honors experience I have gotten to go out of my comfort zone and learn in a new way which I will need to continue
                    to use even once I graduate.

                <p className="font-medium"> 
                    For this experience I started to learn how to play the guitar and I also worked on the piano which I already knew how to play. 
                    Most of the time for my experience was spent on learning the basics of how to play the guitar, starting with simply hitting different 
                    notes and then moving onto chords and chord progressions. After getting the basics, I began learning short snippets of songs, like the intro 
                    to Hotel California in the video below. For the piano I started to learn a new song and tried to get as far in as I could in the little time in 
                    which I had access to a piano. I started by brushing up on some songs I already knew, but I then moved on to learning Moonlight Sonata's first movement 
                    which I also have a video of below. This experience was very beneficial to me, allowing me to find a good activity for my free time outside of  computers 
                    and technology. It has also helped me to work on some of my bad tendencies and soft skills by getting more experience learning new skills and getting 
                    deeper level understanding of a topic.
